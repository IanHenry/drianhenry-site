## Overview

I’m a computational biologist, data science leader, and educator passionate about how data and people transform ideas into impact.  
With over 15 years of experience spanning **academia, biotech, and corporate R&D**, I’ve worked at the intersection of **science, analytics, and leadership** — guiding individuals, teams, and organisations to grow through evidence, clarity, and collaboration.

I currently lead data science for **Translational Medicine at AstraZeneca**, applying data-driven insights to accelerate discovery and development in healthcare.  
Alongside this, I mentor and coach scientists, professionals, and leaders through my independent tutoring, coaching, and consulting practice.

## Philosophy

My work is guided by three principles:

1. **Clarity through Data** — turning complexity into insight and insight into impact.  
2. **Growth through Learning** — empowering individuals to understand, adapt, and lead.  
3. **Connection through Collaboration** — bridging disciplines, cultures, and perspectives to drive change.

Whether teaching, coaching, or consulting, I aim to bring structure, empathy, and evidence-based thinking to every interaction.
